            <h1>About Mediocre Amateur</h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-04mJDJUYHEyE8JPIEa0-w">Mediocre Amateur</a> is a video series
                centered around the outdoor adventures of Danny Bryson. Adventures are often endurance and elevation oriented,
                with episodes centered on summiting high mountains or traversing a 20+ mile route. The amateurs exercise several modes
                of movement, including running, skiing, hiking, canyoneering, biking, and paddleboarding. Most of the episodes take place
                in the western United States, particularly in Utah and the Rockies. Danny brings a fluctuating cohort of
                friends (Blake, Matt, Aaron, Christof) along on adventures.

                Contrary to their self-titling, the "Amateurs" are quite experienced & fit. Most mountains
                are summited in a single day, and some episodes feature 24+ hour runs. Members of the crew have technical
                knowledge in mountaineering (glacier travel, avalanche conditions, climbing and rappels). They even fly into
                some destinations on a private helicopter... very amateur indeed!

                Contrary to the series name, the venues, videography, and narration are well beyond "Mediocre". Key stylistic
                elements of the series include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Gorgeous drone footage</li>
                    <li>First person filming and interviews</li>
                    <li>Distinctive background music</li>
                    <li>"Doubled back" footage of amateurs scaling trail</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>About this site</h1>
            <p>
                Prior to Mediocre Amateur, I was only vaguely familiar with the geography and terrain of the western states.
                The parks and wildlife areas featured in the series inspired me to build my own adventures, and having a good
                map is critical to planning an adventure! YouTube channel layouts aren't amenable to geographic
                display, so I put together this site.

                The site is plainly styled. Click on map point to view an adventure; a marker will pop up with the title,
                description, and links to a video and GPS track. No more, no less.
